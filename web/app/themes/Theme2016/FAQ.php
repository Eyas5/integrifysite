    <h3 class="questionfaq">Who are you?</h3>
    <div class="faqanswer">
        <p>Integrify is a company enabling integration of immigrants by means of technology. The company was established to respond to the growing Pan-European need of integrating asylum seekers and empowering them to start living a normal life in their new home countries. Moreover, with an aging European population and a growing gap between supply and demand in programming and information technology jobs, we see the influx of refugees as an opportunity for Europe to solve two three big problems at once.</p>
        <p>In total, Integrify is currently a five-person startup itself.</p>
