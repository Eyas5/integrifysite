            <h3 class="headlineeyas">Finding meaning in coding</h3>
            <p class="short-description">Nabard, a native of Iraq, travelled through ten countries to get to Finland. In the future, he wishes to settle down here, get a job in coding and find opportunities to develop himself. He says he’ll never forget what Finland has given him.</p>
            <div class="eyasstory">
                <p>Anywhere he looked, the terrorist organisation Isis was causing death and chaos. 23-year-old Nabard felt that his life was in serious danger, so he had no other choice than to leave his home in Kurdistan, Iraq.</p>
                <p>Nabard embarked on a long and hard journey. He walked over mountains in Iraq and travelled by train for days and weeks. He helped families on the run to carry their babies.</p>
                <p>In Turkey, he heard someone saying that Finland was a safe and stable country. Finally, in January 2016, he arrived in a refugee center in Tornio, and the journey was finally over. In total, he had travelled through ten countries to get to Finland.</p>
                <p>“The winter here was rough, but I decided to survive and prosper”, he says now.</p>
                <h3 class="eyasstoryh">Passion for web design</h3>
                <p>After comprehensive school, Nabard studied computer science for five years, specializing in web design.</p>
                <p>Back in Iraq, he worked for an American company, leading a team of 3–8 persons. He also did translations from Kurdish to English when working with English-speaking customers.</p>
                <p>“Visual studies and web design are my passion, and I used to spend most of my free time perfecting my skills in them. From time to time, I also had the chance to visit my parents and brother”, says Nabard.</p>
                <p>His family is still in Iraq.</p>
                <h3 class="eyasstoryh">Something meaningful to do</h3>
                <p>“Integrify’s training program is a great opportunity for me, not only from the learning perspective, but it also gives me something meaningful to do. Without it, I would spend my days being bored, and worrying about of my situation and things back in Iraq. At the moment, it’s not safe to be in contact with my relatives.”, Nabard says.</p>
                <p>Getting opportunities to develop himself and to use his existing skills is very important to Nabard.</p>
                <p>”My goal is to learn modern programming languages and techniques, like PHP, CSS, MySQL and JavaScript.”</p>
                <p>In the future, Nabard wishes to be able to stay in Finland and find a job in coding.</p>
                <p>“Finland has helped me so much in these difficult times, and I want to give something back. I will never forget what Finland has done for me. I’ll be loyal to this country for the rest of my days.”</p>
                <p>When asked about his dream job, Nabard immediately gets a huge smile on his face and answers: “Coding!”</p>
                <p>Web development obviously makes him happy. So let him code, we say.</p>
