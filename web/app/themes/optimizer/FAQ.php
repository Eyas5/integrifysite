    <h3 id="headfaq">Who can apply for the program?</h3>
    <p id="faqtext">Anyone who has sought for asylum in Finland during the past three years is eligible to apply for Integrify's developer centers.</p>
    <p id="faqtext">You don’t necessarily need to be a recent asylum seeker; we’re looking at all asylum seekers and refugees in the last three years to have a broad scope in our mission to enable integration through technology in Finland.</p>
    <h3 id="headfaq">Do I need to know how to do computer programming (i.e. code) to apply?</h3>
    <p id="faqtext">No. All that is required to join Integrify’s program is a good command of the English language and a strong motivation to learn and work. If you are interested in technology, start-ups, and/or mobile applications it is a plus, but not a requirement.</p>
    <h3 id="headfaq">What do I need to apply?</h3>
    <p id="faqtext">A computer (not necessarily your own!) and an e-mail address. We’ll take care of the rest.</p>
